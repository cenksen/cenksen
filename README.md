### Hi there üëã

I am not quite sure about that in what kilobyte should I fit myself in so that I can transpose myself to you. In a world that is globalizing and constantly renewed, staying behind technology causes people to feel in the Middle Ages. Our aim is to inform the people of that ‚ÄúMiddle Ages‚Äù with educational, instructive methods and plan as if they will have alien technology. I am the grandson of software developers Who transferred the conception of the conqueror's execution of ships from land to the computer environment, And who wrote an installment program for the lands sold by the Pope from heaven, And who entered and print goods in factory warehouses after the Industrial Revolution. I think that our ancestors took critical part in the Renaissance to spread wider. We even printed out the treaties made after WW1 on Word, do you understand? We are also descendants of such people.

I am just one of those benign software that feels obliged to communicate and implement what they know.
